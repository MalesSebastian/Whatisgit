    <p><span class="fline">Git is a software that allows you to </span><span class="part">keep track of changes </span>made to a project over time.
       Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, <span class="part">storing them in repositories</span>, then allowing you to reference them as needed. </p>

      <a><span class="part">Basic</span> functionalities:</a>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul class="func">
        <li><i>git branch</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>A repository is structured on branches. This command can list, create or delete branches depending on your non-option arguments, if there are none of those, existing branches are listed. </p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git checkout</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>Switches branches or restore working tree files. Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if git-branch were called and then checked out. <strong> git checkout commit file </strong> checks out a previous version of a file. This turns the file that resides in the working directory into an exact copy of the one from commit and adds it to the staging area.</p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git status</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>Shows the working tree status(e.g. what files suffered changes but they are not committed).</p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git log</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>Shows the commit logs.</p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git push</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p> Pushes the committed changes to the selected branch updating remote refs along with associated objects.</p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git commit</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>Puts added files(git add file) located in the  staging area inside the repository.</p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git rebase</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>Git rebase updates to the upstream head your local workspace.</p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git stash</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>Saves changes on a trach of unfinished changes. Example: Often, when you have been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else. The problem is, you don not want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is the git stash command.</p>
        </div>
        <li><i>git reset</i></li>
        <div class="lpar">
          <p>Resets current HEAD to the specified state.</p>
        </div>
